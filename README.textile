h2(#1). 1. Description

This script can help you reduce your website loading times by minimizing the size of your website static resources.

It can minify CSS files (using "YUI compressor":http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/), compile JavaScript files (using "Google Closure Compiler":http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/) and compress images (using "jpegoptim":http://freshmeat.net/projects/jpegoptim/ and "optipng":http://optipng.sourceforge.net).

Not only it can compile external JavaScript files, but it can also find and automatically compile blocks of JavaScript code located in your templates / html files.

It would ideally be used some where in your website deployment process.

If you happen to develop web applications using "Django":http://www.djangoproject.com/ and you currently don't use a deployment script, check "django-deployment-script":http://github.com/Kami/django-deployment-script.

h2(#2). 2. Requirements

* Java (http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
* YUI Compressor (http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/)
* Google Closure Compiler (http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/)
* jpegoptim (http://freshmeat.net/projects/jpegoptim/)
* optipng (http://optipng.sourceforge.net/)

h2(#3). 3. Usage

# Set the path to the external tools / binaries in the asset_deflator.py file
# Run the script

@python asset_deflator.py --path=/path/to/your/assets/ --all -v -s@

This will run the script in verbose mode (-v) and a short report will be displayed (-s) at the end.

--all option means that the script will search for css files, javascript files, files with inline javascript and images and try to minify / compile / compress them.

If you don't want to run all the actions, skip the --all argument and for example use --minify-css (this will cause the script to only look for CSS files in the provided path and try to minify them).

By default, the script will create new files with .min suffix after the file name and not overwrite the original files (you can change this behavior with -o option).

For the description of all the arguments, run the script with the --help option.

@python asset_deflator.py --help@

If everything goes well, you should see something like this:

bq.. Performed work on 143 files located in /home/user/somewhere

h2(#4). 4. Frequently asked questions

*Which image formats are currently supported?*

png, jpg and gif (basically all you need, unless you are a guy who is still including 2MB large bmp files on their homepage :P)

*How does this script find blocks of JavaScript code inside my templates?*

Well, the regular expression which matches the inline JavaScript in this version isn't exactly a rocket science, but it will probably work for 90% of the cases.

h2(#5). 5. Notes

This script has been tested and confirmed to work with YUI compressor 2.4.2 and Google Closure Compiler 20091217.

h2(#6). 6. Upcoming features

Packing multiple CSS and JavaScript files together into one file and replacing the references to this files in your templates with the reference to a new file.
